Data Ingestion: 1st define some variables in src\constants
2nd connect all fiels for connecting we write code in config\configuration.py file 
3rd Now we start data ingestion 

In artifact folder we store all outputs(like;downloaded raw data,data ingestion,
data transformation etc pipline)


Data Transformation: We do complete feature engineering here
constan file ->configuration file ->data transformation ->if required, we will create helper function in utils file ->data transformation


Model Training:
steps-
constant ->we define variables
configuration ->configure all variables(connect all variables)
Model Training
utils file (create helper fun if needed)
